# Kindred Editor

**A portable, extensible, and cross-platform post editor model built for Kotlin Multiplatform.**

`kindred-editor` provides a rich, structured foundation for composing and rendering posts across social, blogging, and community platforms. It is designed to be completely UI-agnostic, render-consistent, and easy to integrate into Kotlin applications on Web, Android, iOS, or Desktop.

> **Note:** This project intentionally does not include any UI components. The UI implementation is the responsibility of the consuming project that implements this module.
