# Content Validation Package

This package is intended to contain components related to the editor's content validation system.

## Purpose
The content validation system enforces content rules and constraints, ensuring content integrity and compliance with business rules.

## Planned Components
- Validation pipeline
- Custom validators
- Error reporting mechanism

## Integration Points
This package will integrate with:
- Document model
- Command execution system
- User feedback mechanisms

## Implementation Status
This package is a placeholder for future development. Refer to MissingModules.md for more details on the planned content validation system.

## Relationship with util.validation
While the `util.validation` package contains utility-level validation helpers, this top-level package will provide a comprehensive validation framework for the editor. The utilities from `util.validation` will be leveraged by this package to build a complete validation pipeline.
