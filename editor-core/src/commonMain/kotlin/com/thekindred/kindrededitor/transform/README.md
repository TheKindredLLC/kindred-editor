# Content Transformation Package

This package is intended to contain components related to the editor's content transformation capabilities.

## Purpose
The content transformation system enables flexible content manipulation, allowing conversion between different content formats and block types.

## Planned Components
- Block transformers (e.g., paragraph to list)
- Format converters
- Content normalizers

## Integration Points
This package will integrate with:
- Document model
- Command system
- Clipboard operations
- Export/import functionality

## Implementation Status
This package is a placeholder for future development. Refer to MissingModules.md for more details on the planned content transformation system.

## Features
When implemented, this package will support:
- Converting between block types (e.g., paragraph to heading)
- Transforming lists between ordered and unordered
- Splitting and merging blocks
- Converting content to/from external formats (Markdown, HTML, plain text)
- Normalizing content structure

## Relationship with util.text
While some basic text normalization exists in the `util.text` package, this package will provide a comprehensive framework for content transformations beyond simple text normalization.
